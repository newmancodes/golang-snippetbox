	// otherwise it will always contain the default value of ":4000". If any errors are
	// encountered during parsing, the application will be terminated.

	// The value returned from the flag.String() function is a pointer to the flag
	// value, not the value itself. So in this code, that means the addr variable
	// is actually a pointer, and we need to dereference it (i.e. prefix it with
	// the * symbol) before using it. Note that we are using the log.Printf()
	// function to interpolate the address with the log message.
	logger.Info("starting server", slog.String("addr", *addr))

	// Add we pass the dereferenced addr pointer to http.ListenAndServe() too.
	err := http.ListenAndServe(*addr, app.routes())
	// And we also use the Error() method to log any error message returned by
	// http.ListenAndServe() at Error severity (with no additional attributes),
	// and then call os.Exit(1) to terminate the application with exit code 1.
	logger.Error(err.Error())
